# EIS Demo

This demo site includes [an upload page](http://localhost:3000/upload) which allows the user to upload image files to an S3 bucket. When uploaded data will also be sent across to an API endpoint in [this Django app](https://github.com/andrewBlairDCT/django_s3objects) - so you will need to clone the Django app and run that as well to ensure the upload function works.

## Next JS Stuff

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, [clone the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) into a local folder and run:

```
npm i
# or
npm install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
